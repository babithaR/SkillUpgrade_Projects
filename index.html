            <h3>Project 1</h3><p>
               <b> E-Commerce Shop Web Application</b><br>

                Hosted on: Vercel<br>
                Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  <br>  
                In this project, I developed a fully functional e-commerce web application that allows users to browse, select, and purchase products online. The platform is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, focusing on a seamless shopping experience.
                <br>

                
<b>Front-End Development:</b> Built the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>
<b>Product Management: </b>Product Management: Created dynamic product listings, including features like product descriptions, pricing, and images, to enhance the shopping experience.<br>
<b>Shopping Cart Functionality:</b> Implemented a shopping cart system that allows users to add, remove, and manage products before proceeding to checkout.<br>
<b>Deployment on Vercel:</b> Leveraged Vercel for fast and reliable hosting, ensuring the platform is accessible and scalable for users.<br>
This project demonstrates my ability to create a user-friendly and functional e-commerce platform, highlighting my skills in web development and deployment.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p><b>AI/ML Project: Dehazing Images</b><br>
                In this project, I implemented an AI/ML model aimed at enhancing image clarity by removing haze using advanced deep learning techniques. The project utilized TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a dehazing algorithm.<br>
                <b>Development: </b>Collaborated with a team to design and optimize the dehazing algorithm using CNNs, improving the visibility and quality of hazy images.<br>
                <b>Experimentation and Testing:</b> Conducted rigorous experiments to test the effectiveness of the AI model and refine its performance.<br>
                <b>Project Presentation:</b> Presented the project outcomes at institute events, demonstrating the technical capabilities and results of the dehazing model.
